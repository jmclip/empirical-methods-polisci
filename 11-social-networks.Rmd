# Social Networks

**By Erin M. Ochoa**

## Introduction

This chapter provides an introduction to social networks and some of the methods used to analyze them.

## What is a Social Network? What is Social Network Analysis?

From a high-level view, a **social network** is a model representing *relationships* among *social entities*. **Social network analysis**, then, is a body of methods used to evaluate the characteristics of a social network and its elements. To better understand what these terms mean, it is important to first address what a network is and what elements it comprises. We will also consider examples of networks and approaches to representing them.

### Elements of a Network

In the most basic definition, a **network** is a data structure modeling a collection of units, which are represented as points called **nodes** or **vertices**, and the relationships between them, which are represented by links, called **edges** or **ties**, between the nodes. Two nodes that are connected by an edge are said to be **neighbors**.

A network is also called a **graph**; here, both terms are used interchangeably.

Networks can represent many different types of real-world phenomena. Consider how a network could be used to model each of the following:

-   The genealogical history of the Japanese royal family:

    -   Nodes represent people; ties represent marriages and births.

-   Email correspondence between workers in a corporation:

    -   Nodes represent workers; ties represent emails exchanged between pairs of workers.

-   Flights between all the international airports in the world:

    -   Nodes represent airports; ties represent flights connecting airports.

-   Predator--prey relationships among animals in an ecosystem:

    -   Nodes represent different species; ties represent which animals prey upon others.

-   Mentorship and advising among political scientists in academia:

    -   Nodes represent scholars; ties represent mentor--student relationships among scholars.

-   The order in which blocks of code in a computer program could be executed:

    -   Nodes represent blocks of code; ties represent flow control between blocks.

-   Advice-seeking relationships among all current federal circuit judges in the United States:

    -   Nodes represent judges; ties represent whether a given judge has ever asked another judge for advice.

When the nodes in a network represent people, organizations, or another type of social entity, the graph can be called a **social network**. Which of the above networks are examples of social networks?

### Network Representations

There are different ways to represent a network. The two most accessible methods are sociograms and adjacency matrices.

A sociogram is a diagram that displays the nodes as points and the edges as lines or arrows.

To understand how an adjacency matrix works, first recall that a **matrix** is a rectangular data structure containing numeric values which are organized in rows and columns; the total number of *cells* or values in the matrix equals the number of rows multiplied by the number of columns. An **adjacency matrix** is a square matrix that represents the presence or absence of ties between pairs of nodes in a graph---it tells us which nodes are *adjacent*, that is, which nodes are neighbors. There exists one row and one column for each node, and each cell value identifies whether the nodes associated with that cell are adjacent.

         $A$   $B$   $C$   $D$   $E$
  ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----
   $A$   ---   $1$   $1$   $0$   $1$
   $B$   $1$   ---   $0$   $1$   $0$
   $C$   $1$   $0$   ---   $1$   $1$
   $D$   $0$   $1$   $1$   ---   $0$
   $E$   $1$   $0$   $1$   $0$   ---

  : Adjacency matrix for a network with nodes $[A, B, C, D, E]$. Rows and columns represent nodes; $1$ denotes an edge between tow nodes and $0$ denotes absence of edge, with dashes along the diagonal to demonstrate that a node cannot have an edge to itself. In this network, there exist relationships between nodes $A & B$, $A & C$, $A & E$, $B & D$, $C & D$, and $C & E$.

## Method: Set-up/Overview

### Two Fundamental Network Attributes

The two most fundamental attributes of a network are whether it is *directed* and whether it is *weighted*.

#### Undirected and Directed Networks

The first important attribute of a network is whether there is a direction associated with the modeled relationships between nodes. There are two types of graphs with respect to direction, **undirected** and **directed**.

##### Undirected Networks.

The most basic type is an undirected graph, in which the edges represent *symmetric*, or *reciprocal*, relationships between nodes. The ties in an undirected graph are called **undirected** or **symmetric ties**. Such ties indicate that for any pair of connected nodes, both nodes have the same role in the relationship.

One example of such a graph is the friendship network of students in an elementary school class based on bonds observed by their teacher; if the teacher infers that Inge and Jaylen are friends, then an undirected tie exists between them in the graph (see Figure [\[fig:sn.undirected\_friendship\]](#fig:sn.undirected_friendship){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:sn.undirected_friendship"}). In this network, an edge between two students means that their teacher perceives them to have a mutual friendship; note that a tie does not indicate any hierarchy among the connected nodes.

[\[fig:sn.undirected\_friendship\]]{#fig:sn.undirected_friendship label="fig:sn.undirected_friendship"}

##### Directed Networks.

In a directed graph, each tie has a direction: the **directed ties** in a directed graph represent a *one-way* or *asymmetric* relationship between nodes. We can think of asymmetric relationships as those in which the roles of the source and destination nodes differ.

Earlier, we described a network to model mentorship and advising between political scientists (see Figure [\[fig:sn.directed\_mentorship\]](#fig:sn.directed_mentorship){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:sn.directed_mentorship"}). For each tie in this network, one node has the role of mentor and the other the role of student; note that each node can take on one role or the other, or even *both* depending on the direction of its ties to other nodes. Let there be eight scholars in the network: Akemi, Brett, Chi, Dani, Elvan, Farah, Gal, and Harvey. Akemi is the most senior scholar and was an adviser to Brett and Chi when they were graduate students. Later in their careers, Brett mentored Dani and Elvan, and Chi mentored Farah, Gal, and Harvey. In this network, the direction of the tie is a fundamental aspect of the relationship between two nodes: to say *Brett mentors Akemi* is not the same as saying *Akemi mentors Brett*.

[\[fig:sn.directed\_mentorship\]]{#fig:sn.directed_mentorship label="fig:sn.directed_mentorship"}

A second example of a directed graph is the network of students in an elementary school class based on friendship ties identified by the students themselves (see Figure [\[fig:sn.directed\_friendship\]](#fig:sn.directed_friendship){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:sn.directed_friendship"}): If Inge identifies Jaylen as a friend, then there exists a friendship tie from Inge to Jaylen; if Jaylen identifies Inge as a friend, then there exists a friendship tie from Jaylen to Inge. Kiko identifies both Inge and Jaylen as friends, so there exist ties from Kiko to Inge and Kiko to Jaylen. Inge identifies Kiko as a friend, but Jaylen does not; thus, there exists a tie from Inge to Kiko, but there is no tie from Jaylen to Kiko---despite the tie from Kiko to Jaylen. The ability to denote such asymmetric relationships is the key feature of directed graphs.

#### Weighting

The second fundamental attribute of a graph is whether its ties are weighted. There are two types of graphs with respect to weighting, **unweighted** and **weighted**.

##### Unweighted Networks.

In an unweighted graph, there are no values associated with any of the edges. The relationships represented in the network are modeled as equivalent, regardless of the circumstances surrounding each relationship.

Consider the earlier example describing a friendship network among elementary school classmates as observed by their teacher. In this undirected network, we can consider ties as *dichotomous* or *binary*: between two nodes, a tie either exists or not. Imagine that Inge and Jaylen have been neighbors, friends, and classmates for five years, and both are now friends with Loren, a new classmate who has recently moved to the neighborhood. In an unweighted representation of the friendship network, the tie between Inge and Jaylen is seen as equivalent to the tie between Inge and Loren: the network does not capture the strength, duration, frequency of contact, or other qualities of the friendship bonds, only whether the friendship bonds exist.

##### Weighted Networks.

In a weighted graph, each edge has a numeric value or *weight* representing an attribute of the relationship between its two nodes. Depending on the network, the value can measure the physical distance between two nodes or some aspect of the strength or intensity of the relationship between them or perhaps of the frequency of an event that occurs between the two nodes.

A simple example of a weighted network is an undirected graph of several towns and the highways existing between them. In this network, the weight of each edge is the length of the highway connecting a pair of towns and thus measures the distance between them.

For a directed weighted graph, recall the earlier example of the email correspondence network among workers in a corporation. Consider the case of two workers, Stéphane and Tracy, each of whom has sent emails to the other. To make a directed weighted correspondence graph, assign to each edge the number of emails sent by the source node to the destination node: Stéphane has sent Tracy $11$ emails, so the weight of the tie from Stéphane to Tracy is $11$; Tracy has sent Stéphane $15$ emails, so the weight of the tie from Tracy to Stéphane is $15$. In this case, the edges represent the frequency and direction of email contact between the two workers.

It is possible to convert a weighted directed graph to a weighted undirected graph. This can be accomplished by summing the weights of ties between a pair of nodes and assigning the result to a single undirected edge between the nodes. For the email correspondence network, to replace the directed ties between Stéphane and Tracy with an undirected tie, we add Stéphane's $11$ sent emails to Tracy's $15$ and assign the value $26$ to the link between them. The edges now represent the frequency, but not the direction, of email contact between Stéphane and Tracy.

##### Node Attributes.

Real-world social entities vary in their characteristics---that is, there are *variables* associated with social entities. For example, there exist many types of organizations, such as non-profits, for-profit corporations, government agencies, and intergovernmental bodies. Similarly, there are a plethora of aspects associated with individual people; consider the following: In the United States, generally speaking, age cutoffs define the legal categories of *child* and *adult*; persons with high-school degrees belong to one category, while those who have not attained a high-school education belong to a different one; and those with certain criminal convictions are labeled as felons.

In general, each variable associated with a social actor measures a single aspect of that actor: it may measure height or weight, but not both, for example. These variables may be *quantitative* (a *number*, such as the count of armed conflicts that have taken place in a district, or the fuel efficiency of a vehicle in miles per gallon) or *qualitative* (a *category*, such as a nation's form of government, or whether a state's legal code allows for capital punishment). (For a thorough discussion of variable types, see Chapter 4.)

We can represent the different values of a variable across the vertices in a network using *node attributes*. Here, we will only consider node attributes that represent categorical variables, either nominal or ordinal. A variable may take on a single value from a finite set of all possible categories (the categories are *exhaustive*), with each category being distinct from all the others (the categories are *mutually exclusive*). Note, however, that discrete and continuous variables *can* be converted to ordinal variables by subsetting the possible values into categories. Consider, for example, a variable that captures the count of shootings in a neighborhood with categories such as $0\mbox{--}9$, $10\mbox{--}19$, $20\mbox{--}29$, and $\ge30$; or the weight status associated with each range of BMI values as classified by the CDC ([-@CDC2017]): $\le18.5$ is classified as *underweight*, $18.5\mbox{--}24.9$ as *normal or healthy weight*, $25\mbox{--}29.9$ as *overweight*, and $\ge30$ as *obese*{--}.

In reality, social actors are associated with myriad characteristics, conditions, and states of being. A given scientific study may measure many such characteristics, with each constituting a single variable. While each variable can only take on a single value for a given observation, a node in a network may be associated with zero, one, or several variables. In the earlier example of a friendship network among elementary-school students as inferred by their teacher, there were no variables associated with any node: each vertex represents a student, and no vertex attributes are taken into account. In the case of organization types, each node has a *type*, the categories of which are (in this simplified case) *non-profit*, *for-profit*, *governmental*, and *intergovernmental*. As an example of a network with two variables, consider a graph of ally relationships between nation-states; the first variable captures whether the entity engaged in a military conflict during the previous ten years (a binary variable that takes the value $True$ or $False$), and the second captures total per capita military spending over that same period (an ordinal variable, with each category capturing a range of spending amounts measured in thousands of dollars, such as $[0, 10)$, $[10, 20)$, $[20, 30)$, $\ge30$).

To visualize node attributes in a network diagram, the physical aspects of a node's presentation vary to represent different values; such aspects include color, shape, and size. Sociograms with elements to represent more than two attributes, however, become increasingly challenging to interpret with each additional variable.

##### Multigraphs.

Just as social actors are associated with many characteristics, they are also associated with other actors via multiple types of relationships. Consider the following examples: A pair of nation-states are currently allies but were previously adversaries. Two students who were once roommates have also played together on the softball team. Company A was a customer of Company B, but now Company A has acquired Company B as a subsidiary.

A graph that models multiple types of relationships is called a *multigraph*. In a multigraph, each type of relationship between a pair of nodes is represented by a distinct edge. In each of the three preceding examples, the respective multigraph models two types of relationships. Each pair of nodes in the network, then, would be connected by zero, one, or two edges. In visualizing multigraphs, the type of a relationship is typically represented by varying the color of the link between nodes. As with node attributes, diagrams with increasing levels of complexity are more difficult to interpret.

## Method: detail

Now that we have covered the foundations of social networks, we can consider concepts to study their characteristics as well introduce some special types of graphs. Many of the concepts build on others, so \[something something something\].

### Network Characteristics and Measures

#### Distance

There are many important concepts related to the traversal of a graph from one specific node to another. A **path** is a sequence of nodes connected by edges, spanning from an origin node to a destination node without repeating any nodes or edges [@WassermanFaust1994]. For a directed graph, the path follows the direction of each edge. Note that for any pair of nodes in a network, there may exist multiple paths.

The **path length** is the number of edges in a given path between two nodes, and the shortest path between two given nodes is called their **geodesic** [@WassermanFaust1994]. The sociograms in Figure [\[fig:geodesics\]](#fig:geodesics){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:geodesics"} highlight the geodesics between Kiko and Mega for both undirected and directed representations of the student friendship network.

The **distance** between any two nodes, also referred to as the *geodesic distance* is the length of their geodesic. For example, if nodes $A$ and $B$ are connected by an undirected tie, then their geodesic distance is $1$.

We can find the **mean path length**, also called the **average path length** or **characteristic path length**, by averaging the geodesic distances between all pairs of nodes in the graph [@WattsStrogatz1998].

The **diameter** of a network is the maximum geodesic distance between any two vertices in the network [@WassermanFaust1994]. Note that the path under evaluation is *not necessarily* the *longest path* between any two vertices, but the longest of the geodesic paths in the graph.

#### Connectivity, Subgraphs, and Components

A network in which each node is directly connected to all the other nodes is called a **complete graph** (this is a special case of a **geographic network**, as described later).

A graph in which each node can reach all other nodes via a path is called a **connected graph** [@WassermanFaust1994].

If we take a subset of the nodes in a graph, including the edges between the subset of nodes, the result, called a **subgraph**, is itself a graph. If the subgraph is a connected graph, then it is called a **connected component**. Note that a subgraph consisting of a single node is considered a connected component.

A **disconnected graph** is one in which at least one node is not reachable via a path from at least one other node [@WassermanFaust1994]. A disconnected graph has at least two connected components.

#### Centrality

A node's **centrality** can be used to gauge how important it is, for various conceptualizations of *importance*. There are many different measures of centrality; here, we will discuss three such measures: **betweenness centrality**, **closeness centrality**, and **degree centrality**.

##### Betweenness centrality.

The **betweenness centrality** metric is a measure of centrality that considers important vertices to be those that create connections *between* other vertices. According to Freeman, who formalized the definition of the metric, betweenness is important because "\[a vertex\] falling between two others can facilitate, block, distort, or falsify communication between the two; it can more or less completely control their communication" ([-@Freeman1977 p. 36]). For a given target node, betweenness centrality is found by computing the sum, for all other pairs of nodes in the graph, of the ratio of the number of geodesics between the pair of nodes that pass through the target node to the total number of geodesics between the pair of nodes [@Freeman1977]. More formally, we can write the definition of betweenness for a node $v$ as: $$Betweenness(v) = \sum_{i \neq j \neq v}^{n}\cfrac{g_{ij}(v)}{g_{ij}}
  \label{eq:Betweenness}$$ where $g_{ij}$ is the number of geodesics between node $i$ and node $j$, and $g_{ij}(v)$ is the number of such paths that pass through node $v$ [@Freeman1977]. Note that a similar definition can be used to find the betweenness centrality of edges.

##### Closeness centrality.

**Closeness centrality** is a measure of centrality that considers important nodes to be those with short geodesics to other nodes---that is, they are *close* to other nodes. For a given node, closeness centrality is found by computing the inverse of the sum of all the distances between the given node and each other node in the graph. We can write the definition of closeness for a node $v$ thus: $$Closeness(v) = \cfrac{1}{\sum_{i \neq v}^{n}d(v, i)}$$ where $d(v, i)$ is the geodesic distance between nodes $v$ and $i$ [@WassermanFaust1994].

##### Degree centrality.

A third measure of centrality is **degree centrality**, which considers important nodes to be those that have many neighbors. The **degree** of a vertex tells us its number of neighbors. To calculate the degree of a vertex in an undirected graph, we can simply count the number of edges it has [@WassermanFaust1994]. Let us return to the example of an undirected friendship network among classmates as inferred by the teacher; in this network, if Orla is connected to Parveen, Quinn, and Refilwe, then Orla has a degree of $3$.

For a directed graph, a node's **outdegree** is the number of edges originating from it; the **indegree** is the number of edges terminating at the node [@WassermanFaust1994]. As an example, we can consider the directed friendship network as described by the students. In this network, the students Parveen, Refilwe, Stéphane, and Tracy consider Orla to be a friend, so Orla has an indegree of $4$. Orla, in turn, considers only Parveen and Quinn to be friends and so has an outdegree of $2$.

A network's **degree distribution** describes the probability of a given node in the graph having a degree of a certain value. In practical terms, we can think of it as a set of numbers, where each reflects the count of nodes in the graph with degree of $0$, degree of $1$, degree of $2$, and so on. This will be important later when we discuss *power law networks*.

The **mean degree** of a graph is the mean average of the degrees for all the vertices in the entire graph [@WassermanFaust1994]. For example, if an undirected network has four nodes with degrees $[1, 1, 2, 2]$, then the mean degree for the network is $1.5$. If a directed graph has five nodes with indegrees $[0, 1, 3, 3, 3]$, and outdegrees $[1, 2, 2, 2, 3]$, then the mean of the indegrees is $2$ and the mean of the outdegrees is also $2$; note that these are equal because every edge extending from some node points to another [@WassermanFaust1994].

#### Clustering

In order to evaluate clustering within a network, we must first introduce the notion of a **triple**, sometimes called a **triplet** or **triad**, which is a connected component with three nodes. If a triple forms a complete graph---that is, if each node is connected to both the others---then it is a **closed triple**, also known as a **triangle**; otherwise, one pair of nodes in the triple are not adjacent so it is an **open triple**. An **ordered triple** is one for which the vertex order is a characteristic of the triple; for example, if the vertices $[A, B, C]$ form a complete graph, the ordered triples $ABC$, $ACB$, $BAC$, $BCA$, $CAB$, and $CBA$ are each distinct---but note that the *triangles* formed by each triple are all the same.

For our purposes, we will assume that all edges are *undirected* when considering triples, triangles, and clustering. Note that in many applications outside the scope of this chapter, this assumption will not hold.

We can now define, for any given node, its **local clustering coefficient** or **local transitivity** by taking the fraction of the pairs of the node's neighbors that are in turn neighbors with one another---that is, the number of triangles including the node divided by the number of possible triangles [@WattsStrogatz1998; @Opsahl2013]. An equivalent definition given in Saramäki et al. ([-@SaramakiEtAl2007]) is to compute the ratio of twice the number of triangles that include the given node to the product of the node's degree and one less than its degree:

$$Transitivity_{local}(v) = \frac{2 \times t_v}{degree(v) \times (degree(v) - 1)}$$ where $t_v$ is the number of triangles that include node $v$. This metric measures cohesion among a given vertex and its neighbors [@BarratEtAl2004].

To calculate the **global clustering coefficient**, also called the or **global transitivity**, for a graph $g$, we take the ratio of thrice the number of triangles to the number of all ordered triples---both closed and open---in the graph: $$Transitivity_{global}(g) = \frac{3 \times Triangles(g)}{Triples_{ordered}(g)}$$ where $Triangles(g)$ is the total number of triangles in graph $g$ and $Triples_{ordered}(g)$ is the total number of ordered triples in $g$ [@Opsahl2013].

Finally, we can compute the average local clustering coefficient for a graph $g$ by taking the mean across all nodes: $$AverageLocalTransitivity(g) = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}Transitivity_{local}(n_i)}{N}$$ where $n_i$ represents a node identified by its index and $N$ is the number of nodes in the entire network [@BarratEtAl2004]. According to @BarratEtAl2004, this measure "expresses the statistical level of cohesiveness measuring the global density of interconnected vertex \[triples\] in the network" ([-@BarratEtAl2004 p. 3750]).

#### Density

The **density** of a network is the ratio of the number of edges it contains to the number of *possible* edges. For example, in a network of seven nodes, the number of possible edges is found by the combination $7C_2 = \frac{7!}{2!(7 - 2)!} = 21$. If there exist $12$ edges among the nodes, then the density of the network is $\frac{12}{21} = .57$ or $57\%$.

#### Diffusion

The process of **diffusion** describes the spread of tastes, information, or some status from one node to others along network ties.

### Special Graphs

#### Geographic Networks

A **geographic network** is one in which each node is connected to the *k* nearest nodes, with *k* ranging from $1$ to the total number of nodes in the network minus $1$. If *k* takes on the maximum value---that is, if each node is connected to all the other nodes---then the network is called a **complete graph**.

#### Random Networks

A **random network** is one in which, for each pair of nodes, there is a probability $p$ that there is an edge between them. This probability is a constant for the entire graph and can range from $0$ to $1$.

#### Small-World Networks

The small-world phenomenon describes the idea that in a large population, most people are connected to each other by relatively short chains of acquaintances. In a series of widely known experiments conducted within the United States, Milgram and Travers asked arbitrarily chosen participants to attempt to make contact with a specific target person by mailing or delivering a provided document to someone the participant knew on a first-name basis who was more likely to be personally acquainted with the target person; their findings in one experiment showed that among successful contacts, the average number of intermediaries between the initial participants and the target person was $5.2$ [@Milgram1967; @MilgramTravers1969]. @DoddsEtAl2003 conducted an international email study in a similar vein, finding that successful contacts were transmitted across an average chain length of $4.05$ steps.; when accounting for attrition, they found a median chain length of $7$ steps. These experiments show that the small-world hypothesis appears to be consistent with society at large: in just a few degrees of separation, one's network of friends of friends grows very large. Small-world networks exhibit two key characteristics: (1) the mean local clustering coefficient is high---that is, on average, a node's neighbors are highly connected to each other [@WattsStrogatz1998]; and (2) the mean path length is low---that is, on average, the distance between nodes is short[@WattsStrogatz1998]. Given high average clustering, we might expect such networks to be dense, but in fact, they tend to have relatively few edges [@TakesKosters2011]. Because they have a small mean path length, the diameter---the largest distance between any two nodes---is "exponentially smaller than \[the size of the network\]'' [@Kleinberg2000 p. 845].

These combination of these features results in a network through which information and other conditions, such as infectious disease, propagate quickly [@WattsStrogatz1998].
